## Featured Concepts

### Functional Programming

Functional programming is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Key concepts include:

- First-class functions
- Higher-order functions
- Pure functions
- Recursion
- Immutable data structures

### Logic Programming

Logic programming is a paradigm based on formal logic. Programs are written as a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. Key concepts include:

- Prolog language
- Facts, rules, and queries
- Backtracking
- Unification

### Imperative Programming Languages

Imperative programming is a paradigm where the program describes a sequence of steps that change the state of the computer. Key concepts include:

- Variable assignment
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Procedures and functions
- State and mutability

### Imperative Scripting Languages

Imperative scripting languages are used for writing scripts that automate tasks. They often emphasize ease of use and speed of development. Key concepts include:

- Scripting in languages like Python, Bash, and Perl
- Automation of repetitive tasks
- String manipulation
- File I/O operations

### Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code that manipulates the data. Key concepts include:

- Classes and objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

## Additional Resources
